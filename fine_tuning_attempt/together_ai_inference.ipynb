Reviewer scored high for clarity and coverage due to the inclusion of application and theory questions but emphasized the need for deeper cognitive engagement. Overlap was minimal, but the poorly constructed new question significantly reduced the overall score. To improve, the quiz should focus on real-world applications and challenge students with open-ended, scenario-based questions that require critical thinking, much like the application question on healthcare. Reviewer concludes with a score of 7.4/10, reflecting both the quiz's positive elements and its failure to incorporate new challenge types as instructed.\n"

MCQ: What is the primary goal of supervised learning?\\nA) Predict outcomes for new data\\nB) Cluster data into groups\\nC) Reduce data dimensionality\\nD) Generate new data\\nCorrect: A) Predict outcomes for new data. Reason: Supervised learning trains models on labeled data to predict outcomes for unseen inputs.\\n\\n2. MCQ: Which algorithm minimizes the cost function using gradient descent?\\nA) K-Means\\nB) Linear Regression\\nC) DBSCAN\\nD) Apriori\\nCorrect: B) Linear Regression. Reason: Linear regression uses gradient descent to optimize the cost function for best-fit parameters.\\n\\n3. MCQ: What is overfitting in supervised learning?\\nA) Model performs well on training but poorly on test data\\nB) Model is too simple to capture patterns\\nC) Model ignores noise in data\\nD) Model predicts perfectly on all data\\nCorrect: A) Model performs well on training but poorly on test data. Reason: Overfitting occurs when a model learns noise in training data, reducing generalization.\\n\\n4. True/False: A decision tree can only handle numerical data.\\nFalse. Reason: Decision trees can handle both numerical and categorical data by splitting based on feature values.\\n\\n5. True/False: Supervised learning requires labeled data.\\nTrue. Reason: Supervised learning relies on input-output pairs to train models.\\n\\n6. Short Answer: Explain the bias-variance tradeoff in 1–2 sentences.\\nAnswer: The bias-variance tradeoff balances model complexity; high bias (simple models) may underfit, while high variance (complex models) may overfit, both affecting generalization.\\n\\n7. Short Answer: Compare batch and stochastic gradient descent in 1–2 sentences.\\nAnswer: Batch gradient descent computes gradients over the entire dataset, which is stable but slow, while stochastic gradient descent uses one sample at a time, which is faster but noisier.\\n\\n8. MCQ: Which metric is used to evaluate classification models?\\nA) Mean Squared Error\\nB) Accuracy\\nC) R-squared\\nD) Mean Absolute Error\\nCorrect: B) Accuracy. Reason: Accuracy measures the proportion of correct predictions in classification.\\n\\n9. Short Answer: Describe a real-world application of supervised learning in healthcare.\\nAnswer: Supervised learning can be used to predict disease outcomes based on patient data, such as classifying whether a patient has a particular condition.\\n\\n10. Short Answer: Explain why precision and recall are important in imbalanced classification problems.\\nAnswer: In imbalanced datasets, accuracy can be misleading; precision and recall provide better insights into model performance on minority classes.\"\n",
